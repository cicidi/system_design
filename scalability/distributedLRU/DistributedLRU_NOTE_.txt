requirement

1. An cache with limit of size. remove oldest
	-- should support lookup,insert
2. Eviction policy
	-- does cache need to move latest get to head?
	-- Random replacement 
	-- Least frequently used (LFU) – We keep the count of how frequent each item is requested and delete the one least frequently used	
	-- W-TinyLFU – I’d also like to talk about this modern eviction policy. In a nutshell, the problem of LFU is that sometimes an item is only used frequently in the past, but LFU will still keep this item for a long while. W-TinyLFU solves this problem by calculating frequency within a time window. It also has various optimizations of storage.
3. handle concurrency 
4. distributed cache
