 	-- load  busiest
	   -- but it is kind of complex to query who is most busy
			-- to solve this either have identical file system in each server downside is we have Space(n) 
			-- another solution to have diffencet host name for heavy resource
			-- another solution is use DNS server each time gives different ip 
			by round robin policy , 
				---  downloadsize , one server have heavyweight<F9> work
				--- operating system caches the response  , browser cache the response. it wont make another DNS query, until TTL expired
